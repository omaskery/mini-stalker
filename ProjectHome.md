Mini S.T.A.L.K.E.R is essentially an attempt at a simple 2D version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadows of Chernobyl.

Of course, that was was a highly copmlex 3D game which is highly addictive, entertaining and immersive (for me). I am but a 16 year old hobbyist C++ programer, so i'll be happy with anything resembling some gameplay.

I intend to work fairly hard on this, even if I don't finish this in one go i'd like to keep coming back to it to carry on when I get the motivation!

If anyone wants to contact me about this project you can find me spamming the internet at:
